## About

This repository is your one-stop resource for DSA, covering:

- Fundamental concepts (Big‑O, recursion)
- Commonly used data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, hash tables)
- Core algorithms (sorting, searching, greedy strategies, backtracking, dynamic programming, graph traversal)
- Practical implementations and problem-solving examples crafted by you

**Great for:**

- Preparing for coding interviews (FAANG/SDE/etc.)
- Sharpening competitive programming skills
- Academic and self-paced learning
